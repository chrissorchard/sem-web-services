	abstract = {Version 4 of the Internet Protocol ({IPv4)} has been in wide use for the past 25 years, but it has outlasted its effective lifetime and is straining to keep up with the demands of today's Internet. {IPv6} is a natural evolution from {IPv4} and attempts to address many of the older protocol's shortcomings. {IPv6} is designed to keep up with the rapid growth of the Internet. The core specifications have been standardized through the {IETF's} {IPng} working group, and the {NGtrans} working group is studying issues surrounding the challenging task of smoothly transitioning from {IPv4} to {IPv6.} The paper discusses the benefits of {IPv6} and obstacles to its deployment},
