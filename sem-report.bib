	abstract = {The potential to achieve dynamic, scalable and cost-effective marketplaces and {eCommerce} solutions has driven recent research efforts towards so-called Semantic Web Services that are enriching Web services with machine-processable semantics. To this end, the Web Service Modeling Ontology ({WSMO)} provides the conceptual underpinning and a formal language for semantically describing all relevant aspects of Web services in order to facilitate the automatization of discovering, combining and invoking electronic services over the Web. In this paper we describe the overall structure of {WSMO} by its four main elements: ontologies, which provide the terminology used by other {WSMO} elements, Web services, which provide access to services that, in turn, provide some value in some domain, goals that represent user desires, and mediators, which deal with interoperability problems between different {WSMO} elements. Along with introducing the main elements of {WSMO}, we provide a logical language for defining formal statements in {WSMO} together with some motivating examples from practical use cases which shall demonstrate the benefits of Semantic Web Services.},

This core language is extended in the directions of Description Logics and Logic Programming in a principled manner with strict layering. {WSML} distinguishes between conceptual and logical modeling in order to support users who are not familiar with formal logic, while not restricting the expressive power of the language for the expert user. {IRIs} play a central role in {WSML} as identifiers.

The {XML} based messaging paradigm of {RESTful} services has made it possible to compose various services together. Such compositions of {RESTful} services is widely referred to as Mashups. In this paper, we outline the limitations in current approaches to creating mashups. We address these limitations by proposing a framework called as {SA-REST.} {SA-REST} adds semantics to {RESTful} services. Our proposed framework builds upon the original ideas in {WSDL-S}, our {W3C} submission, which was subsequently adapted for Semantic Annotation of {WSDL} ({SAWSDL)}, now a {W3C} proposed recommendation. We demonstrate use of microformats for semantic annotation of {RESTful} services and then the use of such semanti- cally enabled services with better support for interoperability for creating dynamic mashups called {SMashups.}},

	abstract = {In this article a formal model applying {REST} architectural principles to the description of semantic web services is introduced, including the discussion of its syntax and operational semantics. {RESTful} semantic resources are described using the concept of tuple spaces being manipulated by {HTTP} methods that are related to classical tuple space operations. On the other hand, {RESTful} resources creation, destruction and other dynamic aspects of distributed {HTTP} computations involving coordination between {HTTP} agents and services are modeled using process calculus style named channels and message passing mechanisms. The resulting model allows for a complete and rigorous description of resource based web systems, where agents taking part in a computation publish data encoded according to semantic standards through public triple repositories identified by well known {URIs.} The model can be used to describe complex interaction scenarios where coordination and composition of resources are required. One of such scenarios taken from the literature about web services choreography is analyzed from the point of view of the proposed model. Finally, possible extensions to the formalism, such as the inclusion of a description logics based type system associated to the semantic resources or possible extensions to {HTTP} operations are briefly explored.},

Despite the success of the {UDDI} specification and its rapid uptake by the industry, the capabilities of its offered service discovery facilities are rather limited. The lack of machine-understandable semantics in the technical specifications and classification schemes used for retrieving services, prevent {UDDI} registries from supporting fully automated and thus truly effective service discovery. This paper presents the implementation of a semantically-enhanced registry that builds on the {UDDI} specification and augments its service publication and discovery facilities to overcome the aforementioned limitations. The proposed solution combines the use of {SAWSDL} for creating semantically annotated descriptions of service interfaces and the use of {OWL-DL} for modelling service capabilities and for performing matchmaking via {DL} reasoning.},

Richer semantics can enable fuller, more flexible automation of service provision and use, and support the construction of more powerful tools and methodologies. Both sets of technologies can benefit from complementary uses and cross-fertilization of ideas.

	abstract = {Current industry standards for describing Web Services focus on ensuring interoperability across diverse platforms, but do not provide a good foundation for automating the use of Web Services. Representational techniques being developed for the Semantic Web can be used to augment these standards. The resulting Web Service specifications enable the development of software programs that can interpret descriptions of unfamiliar Web Services and then employ those services to satisfy user goals. {OWL-S} ({“OWL} for Services”) is a set of notations for expressing such specifications, based on the Semantic Web ontology language {OWL.} It consists of three interrelated parts: a profile ontology, used to describe what the service does; a process ontology and corresponding presentation syntax, used to describe how the service is used; and a grounding ontology, used to describe how to interact with the service. {OWL-S} can be used to automate a variety of service-related activities involving service discovery, interoperation, and composition. A large body of research on {OWL-S} has led to the creation of many open-source tools for developing, reasoning about, and dynamically utilizing Web Services.},

	abstract = {{RESTful} services are increasingly been adopted as a suitable lightweight solution for creating service-based applications on the Web. However, most often these services lack any machine-processable description and therefore a significant human labour has to be devoted to locating existing services, understanding their documentation, and implementing software that uses them. In order to increase the automation of these tasks, we present an integrated lightweight approach for the creation of semantic {RESTful} service descriptions. Our work is based on {hRESTS}, a microformat for including machine-readable descriptions of {RESTful} service within existing {HTML} service documentation. We complement {hRESTS} by the {MicroWSMO} microformat, which uses {SAWSDL-like} hooks to add semantic annotations. Finally, we present {SWEET–Semantic} Web {sErvices} Editing Tool–which effectively supports users in creating semantic descriptions of {RESTful} services based on the aforementioned technologies.},
