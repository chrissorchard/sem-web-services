\begin{abstract}

Semantic web services are an extension on the existing concept of web services,
providing a mechanism to semantically descripe the operation and characteristics
of a web service, with the aim of allowing automated discovery, composition and
execution of web services. This report explores the progress made towards this
aim, and finds that the semantic web services community have moved away from
this goal of automation towards a more lightweight approach based on the
annotation of services. The motivations behind this move are investigated and
recent developments with RESTful semantic web services are examined, although it
is not clear to what extent the more recent implementations have been deployed.
